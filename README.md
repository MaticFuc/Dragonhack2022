Learnify is a webapp for helping to learn. With it you can test yourself how well you have studied some materials. It offers multiple different options of how to provide the study materials. You can link to wikipedia articles, Library Genesis books and articles or you can provide raw text. With this app we will help solve problems to teachers, parents and faculty who are unable to find material for their lectures/kids etc.

Then you can select from a various types of questions: multiple choice, gap fill and true/false statements.

By using artificial intelligence and large language models the app will generate questions and answers from the text. You can then answer the questions and the app will display your score and correct answers.

In `utils` folder is source code for generating gap fill multiple choice questions, open ended questions and true/false statements. In the folder there are also source files for wikipedia and textbook extraction.

In other directiories there are files for the web app.
